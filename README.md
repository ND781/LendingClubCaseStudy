## General Information
- A finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers wants to analyze the driving factors that lead to loan default.
- A dataset on borrowers for 5 years (2007-2011) is provided. Different attributes of the dataset include amount of loan taken, number of time the person has defaulted in any account, payment of installments etc. The Company aims to understand patterns in the data so that it can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment. This includes approval of loans, providing the loan at a higher loan rate for those likely to default etc. A data dictionary is also available to understand the fields in the dataset.

## Conclusions
1. Purpose of the loan -
a. If the loan is for small business, then it needs to be approved after proper scrutiny.
b. In terms of loan amount, there is $190M dispersed in debt consolidation, out of which 15% has defaulted. So
more stringent measures needed for such loans
2. Verification Process - The Lending club needs to assess the methods adopted to evaluate the income document
submitted by the borrower.
3. Higher Loan amounts which are provided at higher interest rates are defaulting the most. Hence to reduce risk, it is
better to increase the number of loans provided below $20K.
4. Loans allocated in Grade A, B, C can be further increased. Additional scrutiny and validation needs to be introduced
for loans in Grade F and G.
5. Status of Home ownership is not having any impact on the ability of a borrower to pay back the loan.
6. The Term of the loan is having an impact. Upto 25% of Loans provided for 5 years terms are defaulting.
7. Most loans(both dollar amount and number) are provided in the state of California and so are the number of default
cases. Hence, additional measure need to be in place for loans approved in the state.
